# Project
Library files for Hiwonder JetAuto. JetAuto is an entry-level ROS robot car tailored for ROS education. It is loaded with NVIDIA Jetson 
Nano, high-performance encoder motor, rotatable pan-tilt, Lidar, 3D depth camera and 7-inch LCD 
screen, which opens up more functionalities. Robot motion control, mapping and navigation, path 
planning, tracking and obstacle avoidance, autonomous driving, human feature recognition, 
somatosensory interaction and voice interaction all can be achieved!
