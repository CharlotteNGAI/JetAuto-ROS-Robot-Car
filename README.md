# Project
This project provides library files for Hiwonder JetAuto, a ROS robot car that uses SLAM to navigate through complex environments. The robot uses four mapping algorithms, including Gmapping, Hector, Karto, and Cartographer, to create a map of the environment. Once mapping is done, the robot can seamlessly navigate to multiple points in the environment while avoiding obstacles and continuously establishing its position relative to the map.

JetAuto is an entry-level ROS robot car tailored for ROS education. It comes with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, high-performance encoder motor, rotatable pan-tilt, Lidar, 3D depth camera, and a 7-inch LCD screen that opens up more functionalities. With JetAuto, users can achieve robot motion control, mapping and navigation, path planning, tracking and obstacle avoidance, autonomous driving, human feature recognition, somatosensory interaction, and voice interaction.

[JetAuto is available at Hiwonder official store.](https://www.hiwonder.com/products/hiwonder-jetauto-ros-robot-car-powered-by-jetson-nano-with-lidar-depth-camera-touch-screen-microphone-array-support-slam-mapping-and-navigation?variant=39962923860055)

* Lidar


# Program Outcome
JetAuto creates a map of the environment using SLAM and can move to the target point based on the map. See the images below for examples of the robot in action:
